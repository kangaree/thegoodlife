        <h2>BY TRACY K. SMITH</h2>
        <div>When some people talk about money</div>
        <div>They speak as if it were a mysterious lover</div>
        <div>Who went out to buy milk and never</div>
        <div>Came back, and it makes me nostalgic</div>
        <div>For the years I lived on coffee and bread,</div>
        <div>Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday</div>
        <div>Like a woman journeying for water</div>
        <div>From a village without a well, then living</div>
        <div>One or two nights like everyone else</div>
        <div>On roast chicken and red wine.</div>
    </div>
</body>
